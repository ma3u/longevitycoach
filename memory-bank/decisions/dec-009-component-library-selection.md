# Component Library Selection

## Context

As part of our static GitHub Pages setup (see [DEP-001: GitHub Pages Setup](./dec-001-github-pages-setup.md)), we need to establish a consistent, maintainable, and performant approach to UI components for our static pages. The current MVP uses a combination of component libraries and utilities that we should evaluate for long-term suitability.

## Current Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (React 18)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Component Libraries**:
  - Headless UI (v1.7.0)
  - Radix UI (Dialog, Tabs)
  - Hero Icons (v2.0.18)
  - Lucide Icons (v0.292.0)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Utility Libraries**:
  - class-variance-authority
  - clsx
  - tailwind-merge

## Decision

After evaluating the current setup and alternatives, we will:

1. **Continue using** the current stack for MVP as it provides a solid foundation:
   - Headless UI for accessible, unstyled interactive components
   - Radix UI for more complex primitives
   - Hero Icons and Lucide for iconography
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Standardize** on the following component organization:
   - Use Headless UI as the primary component library
   - Leverage Radix UI primitives for complex components not covered by Headless UI
   - Maintain a custom theme system using Tailwind CSS
   - Document component usage patterns in Storybook (to be implemented)

## Evaluation of Current Libraries

### Headless UI
**Pros**:
- Unstyled, accessible components
- Built by the Tailwind CSS team
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Lightweight and focused

**Cons**:
- Limited component set
- Some components still in development

### Radix UI
**Pros**:
- Unstyled, accessible primitives
- Excellent keyboard navigation and focus management
- Built with composition in mind

**Cons**:
- Multiple packages to manage
- Some learning curve for complex components

### Icon Libraries
- **Hero Icons**: Good for general UI icons
- **Lucide**: More comprehensive icon set with good customization

## Alternatives Considered

### Component Libraries
1. **Chakra UI**
   - Comprehensive but heavier than current setup
   - Includes its own styling solution (Emotion)

2. **MUI (Material-UI)**
   - Very comprehensive but opinionated design
   - Larger bundle size
   - More complex theming system

3. **DaisyUI**
   - Built for Tailwind CSS
   - Simpler but less flexible than current setup

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach to components
- **Performance**: Lightweight, tree-shakeable libraries
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Accessibility**: Built-in a11y features

### Trade-offs
- **Learning Curve**: Multiple libraries to learn
- **Integration**: Need to ensure libraries work well together
- **Bundle Size**: Multiple small libraries vs. one large one

## Next Steps

1. Document component usage patterns
2. Set up Storybook for component documentation
3. Create contribution guidelines for new components
4. Regularly audit and update dependencies
